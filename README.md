# AdeptExec - Productivity App

## About
We are a neurodivergent-led company creating technology that empowers and supports the autism and ADHD community.  

â€‹This application is currently under development and will see many changes in the coming months. Our creators are working tirelessly to provide an app based on personal experience as well as community input. While we aim to create a unique app, please bear with us as we try to push past the current constraints. Keep up to date through our wiki documentation and join our ever growing Discord community! 

### Tech Stack
- FastAPI
- MongoDB
- Expo
- Tailwind

## Design
The architecture for the app was made with the intention of organization and takes a micorservice approach. Currently we are not sharing the overall designs until after the initial MVP launch. These designs will be updated through our Wiki so stay tuned!

## Intended Market
This app was born from personal experience as we realized there wasn't an app properly suited for neurodivergent communities. Initially, our market will consist of users needing some extra productivity help while we work on implementing the family aspect to provide parents and caregivers the ability to give autonomy to their loved ones. We take community seriously and find that through research, neurodivergent people lack proper technical support despite hundreds of apps available. That's why we are listening to our users and adapting an app that can adapt to them. Neurodivergence is a spectrum and we want our app to be the same.

## Project Initialization 
With the app currently under construction, please visit our [Wiki](https://github.com/LilliDarling/audhd/wiki/Backend-Authentication-System) for more information!

## Future Endeavors
### AI Implementation
While we strive to be the best, we will start with simple AI implementation utilizing LLM's and Agents from sources such as Hugging Face and OpenAI. We know that AI can be scary so we intend to follow strict guidelines to make sure our users information is secured at all costs.

### Community Integration
Studies show that Neurodivergent people function better with likeminded individuals so why not bring them all together! Our goal is to create connectivity within the app to provide the best support possible.
